## Void elements : 
A void element is an element whose content model never allows it
to have contents under any circumstances. Void elements can have
attributes. The following is a complete list of the void elements in
HTML : area , base , br , col , command , embed , hr , img
, input , keygen , link , meta , param , source , track
, wbr.

## 3 types of element : 
1. Bolck element - Takes the entire line/row of screen
2. Inline-block element - Takes as much space as it needs to
3. Inline element - appears inline of text. 

## Divs : 
They are just boxes that contains other elements.
We use divs along with nested layout techniques 
to create any/every kind of design.
We device every design into multiple vertical/horizontal
grids to achive whatever the design we want to create.

## Css Grids : 
Css grids are another way to organize our html components to give them
proper structure.
Grid are better way of creating nested layout. It helps 
us design our web page by using rows and cloumns.
When we define grid-templete-columns with 1fr that means it 
will take rest of the screen space available to it. 

So instead of using inline-block to create horizontal divs
we can use css grid to achive the same with lot more flixiblity.


## Inline style : 
When we declare css inside our html directly.
